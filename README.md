vim-lldb Commands
--------

| Command           | List                                                                    |
| ---               | ---                                                                     |
| `:help lldb`      | plugin specific documentation                                           |
| `:Lhelp`          | LLDB's built-in help system (i.e lldb 'help' command)                   |
| `:Lscript help (lldb)` | Complete LLDB Python API reference                                |

LLDB Commands
-------------

All LLDB commands are available through `:L<lldb_command>`. Using lldb's documentation at `:Lhelp` along with `:L<tab>` tab completion for all available LLDB commands is a good place to start. Remember to prepend all commands with `:L`.
For example:

```vim
" set a target file
:Ltarget ./path/to/file
" set a breakpoint under cursor
:Lbr
" run debugger
:Lrun
" get help for continue command
:Lhelp continue
```

Customization
-------------

### Global options


```vim
" add custom path to lldb
let g:lldb_path="/absolute/path/to/lldb"
```

```vim
" enable lldb, default is 1 {enable}, 0 {disable}
let g:lldb_enable = 1
```

```vim
" set lldb to async, default is 1 {async}, 0 {sync}
let g:lldb_async = 1
```

```vim
" set lldb console output color
:hi lldb_output ctermfg=green ctermbg=NONE guifg=green guibg=NONE
" set breakpoint color
:hi lldb_breakpoint ctermfg=white ctermbg=DarkGray guifg=white guibg=DarkGray
```


Verifying Python Support
------------------------

This plugin leverages the `LLDB` module which requires Python support in Vim. Vim's Python version must match `LLDB`'s Python interpreter version exactly.

To verify Vim's Python support, run:

    vim --version | grep python

The output must contain either `+python` or `+python3` indicating support for Python 2 or Python 3, respectively. It is recommended to use Vim compiled with Python 3 as many Vim plugins only support this option.

If Vim warns that it is unable to load vim-lldb on launch, there may be mismatched versions of Python running between `LLDB` and Vim's Python interpreter. Versions must match exactly. To verify Vim's exact Python version, launch Vim and run: 
 
     :pyx << EOF
     import sys
     print(sys.version)
     EOF
     
     " verify this version matches lldb's output below
     3.7.6 (default, ...)



Verify LLDB's version of Python by launching the Python interpreter in LLDB: 

    $> lldb -b -o "script import sys; print(sys.version)"
    3.7.6 (default, ...)


If Python versions are mismatched, either recompile Vim to match the exact version as LLDB or vice-versa. See [lldb caveats](https://lldb.llvm.org/resources/caveats.html) for details.

See [Customization](#customization) for specifying lldb path in `vimrc`.
